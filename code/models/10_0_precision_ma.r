#' Model the attack and defense strength as random effects
#' Assume the strength of each team is a random variable changing over time
#' Regard the process as a random walk
#' The default setting of 'generic0' in R-INLA could be used to implement this specification
#' 
#' Random effects in R-INLA are defined with multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean zero 
#' and precision matrix tauÂ·Sigma
#' The 'generic0' assumes Sigma is a constant matrix
#' 
#' Random walk could be implemented using 'generic0' by setting Sigma to be the structure matrix of random walk:
#'  1  -1
#' -1   2  -1
#'     ...
#'     -1   2  -1
#'          -1  1 
#' the structure matrix is constructed by adding the matrix (represents one step in the random walk) with following form:
#'      i   j
#'  i   1  -1
#'  j  -1   1
#'  (unspecified entries are zero)
#'  
#'  Back to our specification, we take u as a vector of random variables to represent each teams attack/defense
#'  ability at each games, to be precise
#'  u = (xi_{tm1,day1}, ..., xi_{tm1,dayn1},...,xi{tmTs,day1},...,xi_{tmTs,daynTs})
#'  (arranged by team first and then the dates)
#'  Since each team's strength changes over time as a random walk
#'  the corresponding precision matrix will be a block matrix whose block is the structure matrix of random walk
#'  We call this specification, blocked random walk (BRW)
#'  
#'  Further, we could generalize BRW by:
#'  1. Consider the effect from the time difference between two games next to each other
#'  2. Consider the effect from the arrival of new managers (honeymoon period/the first game)
#'  Saying considering those effects, we mean decreasing the precision (increase the variance) by divding 
#'  one-step blocks by a constant related to those effects
